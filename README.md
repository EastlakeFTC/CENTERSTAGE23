## Hello there!

Welcome to the Eastlake FTC code repository for the 2023 Centerstage game!

Since we are 3 rookie teams this year, we decided it would be better for everyone to share code with
all of our teams, just like our 3 robots are almost identical.

Essentially, this is just a place for a backup of our code and a way for each team to share their
new drive and autonomous programs with the others and make it easier to keep everyone at the same level.
